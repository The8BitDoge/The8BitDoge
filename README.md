- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @The8BitDoge
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in combining old school 8Bit graphics, games, crypto and NFTs!
- Sales from all of these outlets will get put back directly into the project through adding to the liquidity pool as well as buying & burning tokens. 
- Our community earns passive BITD (The 8Bit Doge token) for holding. So you can hold your 8Bit Doge with the knowledge that every week, while we're making games, NFTs or merch, you're continuing to receive rewards!
- We, as a team, have a vision for 8Bit Doge and will not stop until we make that vision a reality. We are passionate about the games NFTs and merchandise we create!
With 8Bit Doge, we plan to make a huge impact on the crypto gaming industry by bring back the old school pixelated 8Bit graphics and combining them with the modernization of cryptocurrency!
